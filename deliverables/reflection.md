Module 7 Reflection – Maintaining Secure Systems with SBOMs and Patching

1.How does maintaining updated packages illustrate complete mediation?
  -By making sure that the packages are updated, the system that has already been checked for any security problems. If any of the packages are outdated, then they may let security bypass what is already there. Regular updates make sure that security checks are still there and still fully actually being enforeced.

2.Why is generating a new SBOM after patching essential to assurance?
  -After you patch, basically the software you have on the syatem will be different, The old SBOM will no longer show/represent corrrectly what is actually happening/running. So creating a new SDOM confirms that current system  is working and shows more visibility.

3.What risks persist when organizations delay system updates?
 -If a organization delays systeme updates, it leaves the organization vunerable to those problems and threat actors can take advantage becuase usually these are publicly documented and this can make the organization a target long term.

4.How does this exercise embody the secure design lifecycle principle?
 -This exercise first finds all the components using a SBOM and then figures out the risk by using the vunerability scanning tool. Then the patches are applied to reduce the risks. Then the system is rechecked.It shows that security never ends and its always going to be a ongoing thing rather than a one and done sort of deal.
